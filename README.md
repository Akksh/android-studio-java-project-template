# android-studio-java-project-template
Android studio template for solely creating standalone java projects bereft of android.

Steps to reuse this:
1. Import project as a gradle project into Android Studio. This will create the necessary configurations including the *iml* file.
2. Refactor the package name best suited to you. *com.picode.koku* is just a placeholder.

And with this, lo behold, you have gained the ability to start developing your Java project right inside Android Studio. Isn't this great? No more switching IDEs for java projects.
